Alright, I need to process the given data and extract specific information for the academic job application. Let's go through each step carefully.

First, I'll look at the Mobility Rule. The job application form states that "Mobility-rule-compliance" is set to Yes, so that's straightforward.

Next, checking English Proficiency. In the CV, it mentions "English: Fluent (C1/C2)", which satisfies the requirement. So, English proficiency is confirmed as C1/C2 level.

Now, determining if the applicant has a Master's degree. The job application form shows they have a "Master of the Universe" from Another University in Phantasia, with graduation in 2022. This confirms they hold a Master's degree, so that field should be marked as Yes.

Looking at programming languages, the CV lists Python, C++, R, MATLAB, SQL, and others. The job application form also includes TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, FSL, PsychoPy, CUDA under skills, but I think those are frameworks rather than programming languages. So, focusing on the languages themselves, they meet the criteria.

The job application form doesn't specify if English is one of the required languages, but since it's listed as Fluent (C1/C2), it likely meets any language requirements beyond their native Funny Language.

Other fields like Full-name, Date-of-birth, Nationality, etc., are already provided in the job application and don't need further extraction from the CV unless specified otherwise.

I should ensure that all required fields are correctly filled based on the provided data without making incorrect assumptions. Since the focus is on specific criteria (Mobility Rule, English proficiency, Master's degree, and programming languages), these areas seem to be covered.
