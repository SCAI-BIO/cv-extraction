Alright, I'm looking at the problem where I need to extract specific information from an applicant's CV and job application to form a JSON response. The user has given me two texts: one is the CV and the other is the job application. My task is to parse these documents according to certain rules and structure the output in a strict JSON format without any markdown or trailing commas.

First, I need to understand each extraction rule thoroughly.

1. **Mobility Rule**: Extract this from the application form. If it's stated as Yes or No, use that value. In the job application provided, under "Mobility-rule-compliance", it says "Yes". So, I'll set "Fits mobility rules?" to "Yes".

2. **English Proficiency**: Check if any of the following are mentioned: IELTS 6.5+, TOEFL 90+, or C1/C2 level in English. Looking at the CV under "Languages", it lists English as Fluent (C1/C2). Therefore, this meets the criteria, and I'll mark English proficiency as "Yes".

3. **Bachelor's Degree Details**: Extract the university name, country, degree title, and year of graduation. From the job application, these are:
   - University: My University
   - Country: Phantasia
   - Degree: Computer Science
   - Graduation Year: 2010

4. **Master's Degree Details**: Similarly, from the job application:
   - University: Another University
   - Country: Phantasia
   - Degree: Master of the Universe
   - Graduation Year: 2022

5. **Skills**: List programming languages and frameworks. The CV mentions Python, C++, R, MATLAB under programming languages and TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, FSL, PsychoPy, CUDA as frameworks.

6. **Other Languages**: From the CV, besides English and German (which might be inferred but not explicitly stated here), it lists "Funny Language" as native. So I'll include that.

Now, considering all these points, I need to structure the JSON accordingly. The keys must match exactly what's required: Full-name, Gender, Date-of-birth, Nationality, Country-Contact, E-Mail, Phone-number, LinkedIn-profile, Programming-languages, Skills, Frameworks, Languages, Bachelor-university, Bachelor-country, Bachelor-degree, Bachelor-year, Master-university, Master-country, Master-degree, Master-year, Mobility-rule.

I should ensure that each value is correctly placed under the right key. For instance, "Programming languages" and "Frameworks" are separate keys, so I'll list them accordingly.

Also, I need to verify if all mandatory fields are included. The CV might have more information, but according to the job application form, these are the values provided, so I should stick to that unless instructed otherwise.

Finally, the JSON structure must be valid, with proper commas and syntax. I'll make sure there are no trailing commas or formatting issues.
