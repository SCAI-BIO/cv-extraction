Alright, let's break down how I approached this query. The user provided a detailed job application and CV text for an academic position. My goal was to extract specific information into a JSON format as per the given rules.

First, I noticed that the CV mentioned the candidate has a Master of Science in Data Science with relevant skills but didn't explicitly state a PhD. So, "Holds-Doctoral-Degree" became "No".

Next, for mobility rules, the job application form clearly stated "Yes", so that was straightforward.

Looking at English proficiency, the CV showed "English: Fluent (C1/C2)", which meets the criteria, so I marked it as "Yes".

For nationality, the candidate is from Phantasia, and since Phantasia isn't an EU country, they don't have an ERA citizen status. Thus, that field was left empty.

I extracted all other details like full name, date of birth, email, etc., directly from the job application form as they were more accurate there.

I made sure to format everything correctly into JSON, ensuring each field matched the required structure and data types.
