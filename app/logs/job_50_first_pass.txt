Okay, I need to extract specific information from the provided applicant's CV and job application to form a JSON output as per the given rules. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, looking at the Job Application text, it's filled out with specific details. The Full-name is "Super Hero", Date-of-birth is 19/09/1987, Gender is Female, Nationality is PHANTASIA. Country-Contact is also PHANTASIA. E-Mail is abc@gmail.com, Phone-number is +11 12345678.

Mobility-rule-compliance is Yes, so "Fits mobility rules?" should be set to "Yes".

For English Proficiency, in the CV under Languages: English is listed as Fluent (C1/C2), which meets the criteria. So "English proficiency?" is "Yes".

Looking at the Education section in the job application: Bachelor's degree from My University in Phantasia, 2010; Master's from Another University, same country, 2022. The Degree titles are Computer Science and Master of the Universe. So I'll note those as Qualification details.

Programming languages mentioned are Python, C++, R, MATLAB, plus TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, FSL, PsychoPy, CUDA in Skills. Languages include Funny Language (native) and English (C1/C2).

Now, checking if the applicant has a PhD: The CV mentions Bachelor and Master's but no PhD listed. So "Has-PhD?" should be No.

Looking at work experience: There are internships mentioned, so I'll list them under Work Experience with descriptions. Publications aren't detailed here, so maybe leave that empty or note if any exist.

Other qualifications include advanced knowledge in mathematical modeling and participation in Kaggle competitions. So those can be added to Additional Qualifications.

Now, mapping all this into the JSON structure as per the instructions, making sure each field is correctly labeled and values are accurate.
