Alright, let's break down how I approached this query. The user provided two texts: a CV and a job application. My task was to extract specific information and return it in a strict JSON format without any extra text or markdown.

First, I noticed the Mobility Rule is clearly stated as "Yes" in the job application form. So that's straightforward.

Next, for English Proficiency, I checked both texts. The CV mentions "English: Fluent (C1/C2)", which meets the criteria since C1/C2 indicates a high proficiency. Therefore, I set this to "Yes".

Looking at whether the applicant holds a doctoral degree, I reviewed the job application and CV. The job application didn't mention any PhD explicitly, and while the CV shows they're seeking a PhD position, it doesn't state that they already hold one. So, I concluded "No" for Holds-Doctoral-Degree.

For Nationality, the job application states "PHANTASIA", so I included that. The languages listed were "Funny Language (native)" and English, which I mapped to the JSON structure provided.

I also extracted other details like Full-name, Gender, Date-of-birth, E-Mail, Phone-number, Country-Contact, Bachelor's and Master's degrees, Year-of-graduation-Master, Skills, Programming-languages, and Languages spoken. All these were directly taken from either the job application or the CV.

I made sure to format everything correctly as per the JSON structure provided in the example, ensuring all fields are present and accurate. I double-checked each piece of information against both documents to avoid missing anything important.
