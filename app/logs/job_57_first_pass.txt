Alright, I need to process the provided job application and CV texts to extract specific information into a JSON format. Let's go through each step methodically.

First, looking at the Job Application Text, I see several fields filled out. The mobility rule compliance is explicitly stated as "Yes," so that's straightforward.

Next, English proficiency needs checking. In the CV under languages, it mentions "English: Fluent (C1/C2)." Since C1 or C2 levels qualify, this should be marked as "Yes."

For the Doctoral Degree, I check both documents. The job application mentions a Master of Science and another Master title, but nothing about a PhD. The CV states the career objective is seeking a PhD, but that doesn't mean they currently hold one. So, "Holds-Doctoral-Degree" should be "No."

Regarding Visa requirements, the applicant's nationality is listed as "PHANTASIA," which isn't an EU country. Since the mobility rule compliance is yes and there's no indication of a current visa, but the form might require additional info, I'll mark it as "Yes" for now.

Now, looking at the skills section in the job application, TensorFlow and Keras are listed under frameworks. The CV also mentions these under programming languages. So, including them makes sense.

Putting it all together, I structure the JSON with the required fields: mobility-rule-compliance, english-proficiency, holds-doctoral-degree, visa-requirement, and skills.

```json
{
  "mobility-rule-compliance": "Yes",
  "english-proficiency": "Yes",
  "holds-doctoral-degree": "No",
  "visa-requirement": "Yes",
  "skills": {
    "programming-languages": ["Python", "C++", "R", "MATLAB"],
    "frameworks": ["TensorFlow", "Keras"]
  }
}
```
