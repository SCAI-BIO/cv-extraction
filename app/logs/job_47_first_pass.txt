Okay, I need to extract specific information from the provided applicant's materials and format it into a JSON output following strict rules. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, looking at the job application text, there are several fields that can be directly extracted:

1. **Full-name**: It's given as "Super Hero".
2. **Date-of-birth**: The format is DD/MM/YYYY, which I should convert to YYYY-MM-DD. So 19/09/1987 becomes "1987-09-19".
3. **Gender**: It's specified as Female.
4. **Nationality**: PHANTASIA.
5. **Country-Contact**: Since the applicant is from Phantasia, this should be "Phantasia".
6. **E-Mail**: abc@gmail.com.
7. **Phone-number**: +11 12345678.

Next, checking for mobility compliance, it's marked as Yes. So:

8. **Mobility-rule-compliance**: Yes.

From the job application form, there's a section about their education:

9. **Bachelor details**:
   - University: My University
   - Degree title: Computer Science
   - Year of graduation: 2010

10. **Master details**:
    - University: Another University
    - Degree title: Master of the Universe
    - Year of graduation: 2022

Looking at the CV and additional info:

11. **Skills**: The applicant has frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, FSL, PsychoPy, CUDA.
12. **Programming languages**: Python, C++, R, MATLAB.

Regarding languages:

13. **Languages**: They speak Funny Language natively and English (Fluent). Since English is Fluent, it's categorized as C1/C2 level.

Other considerations:

- The applicant's nationality is Phantasia, which isn't in the EU/EEA or Switzerland. However, since they're applying for a position that requires compliance with mobility rules, but in this case, it's marked as Yes.

Now, I need to structure all these into the JSON format provided earlier, ensuring all fields are correctly filled and any missing information is marked as N/A where applicable.
