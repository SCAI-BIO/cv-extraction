Alright, I need to process the user's request. They want me to extract specific information from two documents: a CV and a job application, and return it in a strict JSON format without any markdown or trailing commas.

First, I'll look at the CV text provided. It starts with "Curriculum Vitae" followed by sections like Personal Information, Education, Skills, etc. The key details here are the languages mentioned, which include English as C1/C2 level. This will be important for the English Proficiency field.

Next, in the Job Application Text, I see that the mobility rule is explicitly stated as "Yes". That's straightforward for the "Fits mobility rules?" field. Also, the applicant's nationality is Phantasia, which isn't an EU country listed, so the Visa required? should be "Yes".

Looking at education, the CV mentions a Master's degree from 2022, but in the job application, it says "Master of the Universe" which might be a joke. However, I need to confirm if that's accurate or just an example. Since the user provided this as data, I'll take it as is.

The languages section in the CV shows English at C1/C2 level, so English Proficiency will be marked as "Yes". The job application doesn't mention any other languages except for a funny one, but since English is already covered, that's sufficient.

I should check if there's any mention of having a Ph.D. In the provided data, I don't see any indication of a Ph.D., so I'll leave that field as "No".

Putting it all together, I need to ensure all fields are correctly mapped and only the necessary information is included without extra details or formatting.
